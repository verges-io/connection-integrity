# connection-integrity
Sitting at Tegel Airport in Berlin I recently discovered that the SSL certificates are intercepted. 
I use these two scripts now to verify the integrity of my internet connection whenever I connect to a WiFi. For public ones you should use a VPN for all destinations anyways, but I thought this might come in handy also in other situations.

I run Ubuntu 18.04 w/ LightDM and Cinnamon Desktop.
